# Social-networking

## Description
This social-networking server-ran application allows users to express their ideas, respond to those of friends, and build a friend list using this social network API. It makes use of Moment.js, a node package for formatting timestamps, a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Express.js for routing. The server launches once the user types 'node server.js' into their integrated terminal, synchronizing the Mongoose models with the MongoDB data. The user will then use Insomnia to test various routes that will render according to what the user would like to edit/adjust
